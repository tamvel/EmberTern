# EmberTern — current state

> **This is the ONE place that answers *"what is done, and what are we working on"*.**
> `CLAUDE.md` holds the rules and the architecture; `docs/history/` holds the narrative of how we
> got here. Neither is the place to look for status.
>
> ⛔ **Keep this file between 100 and 300 lines.** It is a status board, not a diary. When a stage
> closes, its row here becomes one line and its narrative goes to `docs/history/`. If you are about
> to paste a multi-paragraph "shipped" report here, you are recreating the defect that produced a
> 6 849-line `CLAUDE.md` twice — see `docs/history/30-claude-md-current-state-archive.md`.

## 1. Entry state

| | |
|---|---|
| Branch | **`master`** — current, clean working tree |
| HEAD | `2ce68fe` *merge(fix): trzy defekty z jednego zgloszenia uzytkownika (2026-08-12)* |
| Build | **0 warnings / 0 errors** (`TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`) |
| Tests | **8 799 / 8 799 green** |
| Version | **0.5.0** (`Directory.Build.props` — the single source; 0.x is deliberate) |
| Remotes | `origin` (company Gitea) + `private` (GitHub) — **both** receive every accepted stage |

⚠ **Both long-running feature branches are now merged into `master`.** `feat/product-polish` and
`feat/localization` still exist on both remotes by earlier instruction, but `master` is an ancestor-
superset of both, so **a new session starts from `master`**. (Older notes telling you to start from
`feat/product-polish` are stale — that decision was about timing and its moment has passed.)

⚠ **Test-count and partition figures go stale every stage. Measure, do not quote.** The headless
partition filter is a list of class names and must be **derived**, never transcribed — a missing
exclusion fails silently (the class runs in the wrong partition and hits the global-`Loc` race):

```bash
grep -rln HeadlessCollection tests/EmberTern.Tests/*.cs | xargs -n1 basename | sed 's/\.cs$//'
```

## 3. Open work

⏭ **There is no stage in progress. The next topic is a user decision.** The ratified localization
order (C0) is exhausted, Product Polish §13 has no item after M5, and the debugger is closed.

### Ratified but not started — each with a measured scope

| Item | Scope / why it waits | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Spacing stage** | 969 local `Spacing`/`Padding`/`Margin` values app-wide; `Padding` reads a role **zero** times. Ratified as its own stage; a guard already prevents growth. | `design/product-polish-m5-next-session.md` |
| **App-wide UX sprint** | Global control density (base controls sit on Fluent's 32 px) **+** monospace font consolidation — re-measured at **7 strings / 95 occurrences / 33 files**, so it decides `Cascadia Code` vs `Cascadia Mono` for every code surface at once. | `design/settings-center.md` §2.7, §7.1 |
| **`KindLabel` / `SymbolKind`** | ~8 Quick Info fact *values* that are our own words. A **contract** decision on `QuickInfoFact` (Core should hand up `SymbolKind` as data), not cleanup. ⛔ Do not declare kind keys in Core — App already owns that vocabulary. Cost today: a Polish reader sees *"Rodzaj: Table"* while the tree says *"Tabela"*. | `history/28` (C2) |
| **Find/Replace panel** | ⭐ **Ratified 2026-08-12: our own panel over AvaloniaEdit's search ENGINE** (this does not reverse `history/12`'s "no second engine" rule — that rule is about the engine, and the engine stays theirs). Forced by measurement: AvaloniaEdit 12.0.0 exposes **no localization seam** for `SearchPanel` — no `Localization` type, no message hook in its public API, and a `pl` satellite is impossible because the assembly is strong-named. 15 strings; the seams (`EditorSearch`, the command registry, `SqlEditorBehavior.Attach`) already exist as single places. ⛔ Three unknowns must be measured first — see §5. | `design/find-replace-panel.md` |
| **D14 — Step Back** | Debugger. Analysed, architecture ratified (snapshot + per-step savepoint + **undo-only**, no replay), deliberately **not** built. Returns only if real usage asks. | `design/firebird-debugger-implementation-plan.md` (D14) |
| **C3.4 — debugger root frame from AST header** | Would lift the "header must be byte-identical" gate on a draft-sourced session, resolve `TYPE OF`, and add the mandatory catalog-vs-draft fidelity case. Deferred pending real usage. | `design/firebird-debugger.md` |

### Localization residue

| Item | Note |
|---|---|
| ≈430 hardcoded strings | Not user-visible surfaces already migrated; the tail. `design/localization.md` §7 |
| 30 `(s)` hedges in the App catalog | Same class as plurals, solved by an English convention Polish does not have (`„8 wiersz(y)"` is wrong for 1 and 2). Own scope. |
| **#353 in Data Import** | The banner does not survive a language change — `SetStatus` stores rendered text and the module has no `RefreshLocalizedText`. Measured: **31 call sites, 18 with ready `UiStrings` text**, so reviving one path would leave 18 frozen statuses beside one live. A decision about `SetStatus`, not a migration leftover. |

### Deferred technical debt

| Item | Note |
|---|---|
| **Charset silent data loss** | Measured on live FB5: a character outside the **connection** charset stores as `?` with **no error**, even into a UTF8 column, and `WIN1250` is the default. Needs ONE shared guard (natural home `CharsetCatalog`, `EncoderExceptionFallback`). ⚠ The statement-**text** path (`FirebirdDdlExecutor`) is **unmeasured** — measure it first; if confirmed it could corrupt user source code. Own architectural audit. |
| **Full-suite hang** | Intermittent, in the headless partition (#94/#226/#261). Three candidate causes, none proven; the run is split into three partitions as the working answer. ⛔ Its own infrastructure task — never detour a stage into it. |
| Activity Monitor / Data Import width at 150 %/175 % DPI | Ratified as debt: both command bars are bare horizontal `StackPanel`s (~1130 DIP) with **no** `ScrollViewer`, so they clip rather than compress. Not a DPI defect — they do not fit at 100 % on 1366×768 either. |
| **B1** — `TableDetailTabView` private icons | PK/FK/Unique drawn with a raw `<Path>` over locally declared geometries on a **14**-unit grid, invisible to three mechanisms at once. Prepared and measured; appearance deliberately unresolved. |
| **Z‑3** — Table Data row height | A density question; cause must be found first (a taller row may be a deliberate readability decision). |
| Icon literal tail 10/11/13/15 | A question about roles, not a sweep. |
| `DataImportProbe` does not compile | **Pre-existing**, out of solution (so `dotnet build EmberTern.slnx` never compiled it); 20 checks of a closed module rotted silently. Data Import has a standing "return only for a real functional defect" directive. |
| `OfferRecompileDependentsAsync` is dead code | Was the intended consumer of `CompiledExistingObject`; reviving it changes what Save does. |
| `BindBareReference` ordering | A bare name in a query resolves to a **local** before a column; Firebird prefers the column. Worth its own measurement. |
| Grid column widths in settings export | Flushed only at window close, so an export can carry stale widths — same shape as the workspace defect fixed in Settings Center 5b, one layer further in. |
| `DatabaseApplyFailure.DatabaseInUse` | Lost its measured justification when Read Only left V1 scope; no longer provably reachable. |

## 4. Standing user directives

These outrank convenience and are not up for re-litigation. Full text in `CLAUDE.md`.

- **§0 / rule #11 — never lose information.** If EmberTern cannot prove it reproduces an object
  identically, it must not modify it automatically.
- **No autocommit, ever.** Auto-*begin* yes; auto-*commit* has no toggle and no setting.
- **One task at a time.** A cross-cutting problem found mid-stage goes to the backlog **with its
  measurement**, not into the current stage.
- **Root cause before symptom.** A report says *where* the user saw it, not *what* is broken.
- **Verify Firebird behaviour, never infer it** — use `Lab/EmberTern_Lab.fdb`.
- **Push to both remotes after every accepted stage.**
- **Measure before quoting a number.** Counts kept in prose have gone stale in this project
  repeatedly, and always in the direction nobody re-checks.
