## P1 — AST: exception handlers (2026-07-17)

**Goal.** Make `WHEN … DO` readable from the AST. The interpreter (D1) owns exception control flow — like
`IF`/`WHILE`, it is client-owned — but the tree gave it nothing to read: handlers were an unstructured
`PsqlLeafKind.Other` token bag. P1 is a pure **parser-producer → binder-consumer** deepening, additive
only, following Etap 6.9's contract (formatter convergence deferred — build grammar depth only when a
feature needs it).

### The one spec refinement (decision 3, ratified by the user)

The brief prescribed a `WhenHandler` with a **single** `WhenHandlerKind` per node. Reading the Firebird
grammar showed that a single `WHEN` may list **several** conditions, comma-separated, sharing one `DO`
body:

```sql
WHEN GDSCODE grant_obj_notfound, GDSCODE grant_fld_notfound, EXCEPTION my_exc
DO BEGIN … END
```

A single kind cannot represent that (all conditions share one body, so they cannot be separate nodes).
Per Developer Contract #15 ("never silently change the frozen design — stop, report, get a decision"),
implementation halted and the question was raised. The user chose to model the real grammar: **a
`WhenHandler` holds one `WHEN` clause with an ordered list of conditions**, and D1's `ExceptionRouter`
matches them in declaration order (conditions within a clause left-to-right, clauses top-to-bottom). Spec
§3.6 + the decision log + the P1 brief were updated to record this before coding resumed. This is a model
refinement to match Firebird faithfully, not a debugger-architecture change.

### What was built

**AST (`Ast/PsqlNodes.cs`).**
- `WhenHandlerKind` — `Any` / `ExceptionName` / `GdsCode` / `SqlCode` / `SqlState`.
- `WhenCondition : SqlNode` — one condition (kind + its tokens); an `ExceptionName` condition surfaces the
  folded user-exception name (`ExceptionName`), the other kinds keep their operand only in `Tokens`.
- `WhenHandler : PsqlStatement` — one `WHEN … DO` clause: an ordered `Conditions` list + a `Body`
  (`SqlNode?`). `Children` = conditions then body (source order). Deliberately **not**
  `IExecutableStatement` — the clause is control-flow routing; its body statements are the step points.
- `BlockStatement.Handlers` (`IReadOnlyList<WhenHandler>`), added to `Children`. `Children` is built by a
  two-pointer **merge** of `Statements` + `Handlers` by source position (not a concatenation): in
  well-formed PSQL every statement precedes every handler, but a malformed trailing `WHEN` (a lossless
  `Other` leaf that lands in `Statements`) can interleave, and the well-formedness invariant
  (`StructuralAstDifferentialTests`) requires non-decreasing child order.

**Parser (`SqlParser.Psql.cs`).** `ParsePsqlBlockBody`'s three unit loops now route through
`ParseBodyUnit`, which sends a recognised `WHEN … DO` clause to `handlers` and everything else (statements,
and malformed/unrecognised `WHEN`s) to `statements`. `ParseWhenHandler`:
- Finds the clause's `DO` via `FindWhenDoIndex` — the first paren-depth-0 `DO` before the next depth-0
  `WHEN`/`END`/end-of-input (so a following clause's `DO` is never mis-attached).
- Parses the condition list (`ParseWhenConditions` → comma-split → `ParseOneWhenCondition`), recognising
  each condition **strictly by its leading keyword** (never guessed from text).
- Parses the body via `ParsePsqlUnit` (so a `BEGIN … END` body, a single leaf, or a reused DSQL statement
  all work).
- Falls back — exactly like `ParsePsqlIf` on a missing `THEN` — to a lossless `PsqlLeafStatement`
  (`Other`) when there is no `DO`, an empty condition list, or an unrecognised condition keyword. A `WHEN`
  at a body-unit position can only be an exception handler (a CASE/MERGE `WHEN` lives inside a leaf/DSQL
  statement the leaf collector consumes whole), so this is unambiguous.

**Binder (`SemanticBinder.Psql.cs`).** `BindBlock` now also iterates `block.Handlers`. `BindWhenHandler`
references each `EXCEPTION <name>` condition as a `SchemaObject` (resolved when metadata knows it, else a
plain unresolved occurrence — error-tolerant; the other condition kinds carry no schema reference) and
binds the handler body against the **enclosing** scope (Firebird PSQL has no block-local scopes — the one
`RoutineBody` scope is the whole body's, the simplification the rest of the binder already relies on). A
handler body that is itself a block recurses through `BindBlock`, so a nested handler section binds too.

### §0 / formatter byte-identity

`SqlFormatter` was **not touched**. Its PSQL layout is token-based (`EmitPsqlUnit` walks tokens; a
`WHEN` clause falls through to `CollectPsqlStatement`), and no existing test/corpus input contains a
`WHEN` handler, so no existing formatting changed. The only coupling — `BuildLeafIndex` — is keyed by a
collected statement's first-token start; a `WhenHandler` is not an indexed leaf type, so a handler clause
now takes the pure token-layout path. New handler shapes added to `SqlTestCorpus.StructuralConstructs` are
held to the formatter's idempotency + §0 token/comment-preservation invariants (guaranteed by the
formatter's per-statement lexeme net regardless), and to the B0 differential harness's byte-for-byte
round-trip + tree well-formedness. All green.

### Tests

- `PsqlAstTests` (+11): each handler form (ANY / EXCEPTION / GDSCODE / SQLCODE / SQLSTATE), the
  multi-condition clause (ordered conditions + the trailing `EXCEPTION` name), multiple clauses in
  declaration order, a block body, and three fall-back cases (no `DO`, empty condition list, unrecognised
  condition keyword) — each asserting the clause is **not** a handler and the round-trip stays byte-exact.
- `SemanticModelTests` (+4): the `EXCEPTION <name>` reference resolves against a fake catalog / stays an
  unresolved occurrence when unknown; a multi-condition `WHEN` references each `EXCEPTION` name (but not a
  `GDSCODE` operand); a handler body's local variable resolves to the routine's `DECLARE`.
- `SqlTestCorpus.StructuralConstructs` (+6 handler shapes) feeds the differential + formatter invariant
  suites.

**Test-writing note (not a numbered gotcha — too minor):** a malformed `WHEN` clause that falls back to
`ParsePsqlLeaf` gets its `PsqlLeafKind` from `ClassifyLeaf`, which returns `Assignment` whenever the leaf
contains a top-level `=` (e.g. `when do x = 2;`). The `Kind` of a fallback leaf is therefore incidental —
assert **"not a handler" + lossless round-trip**, never `Kind == Other`, for a malformed-WHEN test.

### Verification

Build 0 warnings / 0 errors. Tests run in two partitions to sidestep the documented full-suite hang
(#94/#226): **4612** green with `ConnectionExpandBindingProbe` excluded, then that class **alone** green
(27) — 4639 total, all green. Smoke: app launches cleanly. No live-engine (lab) work was needed — P1 is
pure AST/binder structure over the parser, and the multi-condition `WHEN` grammar is documented Firebird
syntax (stated as such in the session; the SYSDBA password for a live probe was not available, and
`isql` cannot reach the repo path anyway — #149).
